To handle the more complex deployment and operations of modern applications, there is a need for a culture change towards **DevSecOps**, a buzzword for improved collaboration between developers, security, and operations teams.
This collaboration should be **supported by automated processes**, like a self-service for developers to get access to the tools they need.

The automated process of testing applications and deploying them into production is called **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery** (CI/CD). 

The CI/CD tools universe is always in flux.
